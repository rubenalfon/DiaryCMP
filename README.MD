# Diary CMP - A Compose Multiplatform Application

Diary CMP is an example of how **Compose Multiplatform** can be used as a real, practical, and powerful framework for developing multiplatform applications. This app includes:

- **Firebase authentication** (login/register)
- **In-device encryption** for enhanced security
- **Beautiful statistics** for insights
- **Platform personalization** for a better user experience

## About the App

The goal of this app is to provide a **secure bullet journal** across multiple platforms. Users can:

- Write and manage their diary entries
- Adjust the order of diary components
- View all registered diary entries
- Analyze statistics
- Set up notifications to remind them to write their diary

## Firebase Setup (Required)

For security reasons, you **must** provide a Firebase repository. It's simple to set up:

1. **Create a Firebase repository** (any name and details work).
2. **Initialize Firestore** and add the following security rules:

```plaintext
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;

      // Allow access to subcollections under each user.
      match /{document=**} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Enable Email Authentication**, but **disable "Email link (passwordless sign-in)"**.
4. **Retrieve the Web API Key and the project ID**:
  - Go to **Project Settings** in Firebase.
  - Copy the **Web API Key** (example: `AIzaSyCr9H27...` **(this one wonâ€™t work, use your own!)**).
  - Copy the **Project ID**
5. **Update the project**:
  - Open the project in your IDE.
  - Locate the file: `diary/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/es/diaryCMP/utilsModule/utils/FirebaseConstants.kt`
  - Replace the constant `APIKEY` with **your Web API Key**
  - Replace the constant `PROJECT_ID` with **your Project ID**
